        "##YouTube Assistant: AI-Powered Video Finder and Query Responder\n",
        "The project aims to create a web-based application that provides intelligent re\u0002sponses to user queries. The system is designed to address two major use cases: finding relevant YouTube videos based on user queries and answering general knowledge questions using advanced language models. This is achieved by lever\u0002aging technologies like Python, LangChain, CTransformers, and the YouTube Data API, combined with an interactive user interface built using Streamlit. The application aims to help users easily discover video content related to their queries and also offer accurate responses to a wide range of informational questions. By combining video search capabilities with an AI-powered query responder, the assistant is capable of handling a diverse range of user needs, creating a more dynamic and personalized interaction experience.\n",
